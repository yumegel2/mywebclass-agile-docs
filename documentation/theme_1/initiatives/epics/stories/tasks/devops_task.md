Task Title: Implement Automated Unit Testing

User Story: As a software developer, I want to implement automated unit testing to catch code defects early on in the development process.

Description: Implement automated unit testing for the software application using a testing framework such as JUnit or NUnit. The unit tests should cover all major functionalities and use cases of the application. The acceptance criteria for the automated unit testing include:
* All major functionalities and use cases of the application are covered by unit tests.
* The unit tests should be automated and run automatically as part of the build process.
* The unit tests should be well-documented and easily understandable by other developers.
* The unit tests should be regularly maintained and updated as the application code changes.

Effort Estimate: 30 hours

Assigned To: Software Developer

Priority: High

Status: In progress

Notes: The software developer needs to work closely with the testing team to ensure that the unit tests cover all major functionalities and use cases of the application. The automated unit tests should be integrated with the build process and run automatically after every build. The unit tests should be reviewed by the development team and testing team before finalizing them. Any changes to the application code should be accompanied by updates to the corresponding unit tests.
