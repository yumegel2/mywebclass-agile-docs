User Story: As a software developer, I want to be able to deploy the current development branch to my local environment with a single command, so that I can quickly test changes and debug issues.

Acceptance Criteria:
The deployment command should be a single command.
The command should pull the latest changes from the development branch.
The command should build the project and install dependencies if necessary.
The command should start the server and open it in my web browser.

Technical Details:
The deployment script should be written in a scripting language such as Bash or Python.
The script should use Git to pull the latest changes from the development branch.
The script should use a package manager such as npm or pip to install dependencies.
The script should use a build tool such as Webpack or Gulp to build the project.
The script should use a command-line tool such as Node.js or Python to start the server.
The script should use a browser automation tool such as Selenium or Puppeteer to open the server in a web browser.

User Interface:
The deployment command should be run from the command line or terminal.
The command should display progress and any errors or warnings during the deployment process.

Additional Notes:
The deployment script should be portable and work on any development environment.
The script should include options to customize the deployment process, such as specifying the server port or disabling browser auto-open.
