"Automated Deployment of Current Development Branch for Manual Review"

Description: The goal of this epic is to implement automated deployment processes that can deploy the current development branch to team members' local environments, facilitating manual review and testing. This will help increase the efficiency of the review process, reduce the risk of errors and defects, and ensure that team members are working with the most up-to-date version of the software.

Goals:
Implement automated deployment processes that can deploy the current development branch to team members' local environments
Ensure that deployment processes are efficient and reliable
Improve the review and testing process by providing team members with the most up-to-date version of the software
Reduce the risk of errors and defects by catching issues early on in the review process

User Stories:
As a software developer, I want to be able to deploy the current development branch to my local environment with a single command
As a software tester, I want to be able to test the most up-to-date version of the software in my local environment
As a product owner, I want to be able to track the progress of the review process and ensure that issues are being addressed in a timely manner

Dependencies:
Availability of necessary tools and infrastructure for automated deployment
Clear and comprehensive software requirements

Risks:
Technical issues with automated deployment tools or infrastructure
Miscommunication or misunderstandings about deployment processes or requirements
Challenges with coordinating and managing the review process

Mitigation Strategies:
Conduct thorough planning and preparation before implementing automated deployment
Establish clear deployment requirements and priorities with stakeholders
Regularly review and update deployment processes to ensure they remain efficient and reliable
Establish clear communication and expectations around the review process

Estimated Effort: 2-4 weeks

Business Value:
Increased efficiency and productivity through automated deployment processes
Improved software quality through catching issues early on in the review process
Reduced risk of errors and defects through early detection and resolution
Greater transparency and visibility into the review process for stakeholders

Priority: High, as implementing automated deployment processes is critical to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the review process.
