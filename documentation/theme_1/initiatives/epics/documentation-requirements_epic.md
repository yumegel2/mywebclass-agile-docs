"Develop Comprehensive Project Scope and Requirements Documentation"

Description: The objective of this epic is to develop comprehensive project scope and requirements documentation for a project. This documentation will include a detailed description of the project's objectives, deliverables, and constraints, as well as any assumptions that have been made. The purpose of this documentation is to ensure that all stakeholders are aligned on the project's scope and that the project team has a clear understanding of what needs to be delivered.

Goals:
*Define the project's objectives, deliverables, and constraints
*Ensure that all stakeholders are aligned on the project's scope
*Provide a clear understanding of what needs to be delivered
*Identify and manage project risks and assumptions

User Stories:
* As a project team member, I want to create a detailed project charter so that I can clearly define the project's objectives, deliverables, and constraints.
* As a project team member, I want to conduct stakeholder interviews and workshops so that I can identify and document stakeholder requirements.
* As a project team member, I want to document project risks and assumptions so that I can manage them throughout the project lifecycle.
* As a project team member, I want to review and validate the project scope and requirements documentation with stakeholders so that we can ensure that everyone is aligned on the project's scope.

Dependencies:
* Availability of key stakeholders for interviews and workshops
* Access to relevant project information and documentation

Risks:
* Stakeholders may have conflicting requirements or expectations
* Key stakeholders may not be available for interviews and workshops
* Assumptions may be incorrect or incomplete

Mitigation Strategies:
* Conduct thorough stakeholder analysis and engage with stakeholders early and often throughout the project
* Schedule stakeholder interviews and workshops well in advance and ensure that all necessary stakeholders are included
* Validate assumptions and document any changes to assumptions as the project progresses

Estimated Effort: 4-6 weeks

Business Value:
* Improved project outcomes through clear definition of project scope and requirements
* Increased stakeholder alignment and engagement
* Improved risk management through identification and management of assumptions and risks

Priority: High, as this epic is critical to the success of the project and should be completed early in the project lifecycle.
