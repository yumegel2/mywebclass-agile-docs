"Automated Testing to Catch Issues Early On and Adapt to Changing Requirements"

Description: The goal of this epic is to implement automated testing processes that can catch issues early on in the development process and adapt to changing requirements. This will help improve the quality of the software being developed, increase efficiency, and reduce the risk of errors and defects.

Goals:
Implement automated testing processes that can catch issues early on in the development process
Ensure that automated tests are comprehensive and cover all necessary use cases
Make the testing process efficient and repeatable
Adapt to changing requirements through agile testing methodologies

User Stories:
As a software developer, I want to implement automated unit testing to catch code defects early on in the development process
As a software developer, I want to implement automated integration testing to ensure that all components work together properly
As a software tester, I want to create comprehensive test cases that cover all necessary use cases
As a product owner, I want to be able to adjust testing priorities and requirements as the project progresses

Dependencies:
Availability of necessary tools and infrastructure for automated testing
Clear and comprehensive software requirements

Risks:
Incomplete or inaccurate test cases
Technical issues with automated testing tools or infrastructure
Challenges with adapting to changing requirements

Mitigation Strategies:
Conduct thorough planning and preparation before implementing automated testing
Establish clear testing requirements and priorities with stakeholders
Regularly review and update test cases to ensure they remain accurate and relevant
Maintain and regularly update automated testing tools and infrastructure

Estimated Effort: 4-6 weeks

Business Value:
Improved software quality through catching issues early on in the development process
Increased efficiency and productivity through automated testing processes
Reduced risk of errors and defects through comprehensive test cases
Greater flexibility and adaptability through agile testing methodologies

Priority: High, as implementing automated testing processes is critical to improving the quality and efficiency of software development.
